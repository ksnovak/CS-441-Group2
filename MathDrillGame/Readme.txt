-----
Starting the program
-----
Open the executable to start.
It will generate some test users for you, including an administrator
Select a user and click "Log in"


-----
Logging in as a teacher
-----
Logging into a Teacher account will open up a form for creating random problems for your students. 
To exit the teacher screen at any time, click the "Log out" button.
The Teacher screen also has buttons for viewing Reports and creating new users.

To create a set of problems:
1) Select a student
2) Fill in the range for the problem sets, in the "Minimum number" and "Maximum number" fields.
3) Select whether the sets will be addition or subtraction (each set will only have one operation, no mixing)
4) Fill in how many problems will be in the set
5) Click "Generate!"

That will randomly generate a set of problems within that range for the selected student. You can see a printout of the problems created in the text box labeled "Problems generated:".
You may repeat that process as many times as you would like, for as many students as you would like.


-----
Teacher's Reports form
-----
The teacher form has a Reports button, for seeing reports about your students. Click on the Reports button to open that window.

In the Reports screen, to see statistics about your students:
1) Select a student
2) Specify a timespan for reports (Default values are from the very beginning to the very end of 2014)
3) If you want to see problems which have been assigned, but not yet attempted, click the checkbox.
At this point, any sets matching those requirements will show up below, and general information about the student will be shown to the right.

To see statistics about a specific problem set (or sets) assigned to that student:
1) Follow the previous steps
2) Select the desired problem set or sets (hold CTRL to select multiple)
At this point, information should be added to the text box to the right.

To escape the reports form, click Exit.


-----
Teacher's User Creation form
-----
The teacher form has an "Add new user" button, for adding new users to the system. Click that to open up the creation form.
To cancel the user creation process at any time, click the "Cancel" button.

Within the new user form, to add a new user:
1) Type in a name
2) If you want them to be teachers, check the "Is the user an administrator?" checkbox.
3) Click save to save that user and return
If the new user is a student, it will show up on that list in the Teacher screen.

-----
Student form
-----
Logging into a Student account will open up a form to perform math drills.
To exit at any time, click the "Log out" button, and that will return you to the login screen.

If the student has no problems assigned to them (that they have not yet completed), the screen will say so, and the only thing that will work on it will be the Log out button.
If the student does have problems assigned to them, then a problem will appear on screen. To perform the math drills:
1) Enter your answer in the input box
2) Click the "Submit" button
At this point, feedback will be shown below the problem section. If there are more problems available, the next one will be displayed and the student may continue the process.
If there are no more problems, then the program will say so, and disable everything except for the Log out button.
